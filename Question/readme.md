Question1 :



Given an array A with n elements, find all the pairs in an array 

such that one is square of other number i.e. a[i] = a[j]^2 such 

that i!=j 



For example: 

1 2 4 2 4 7 4



Possible pairs are as follows:



(2, 4) i = 1 , j = 2

(2, 4) i = 1 , j = 4 

(2, 4) i = 1 , j = 6

(2, 4) i = 3 , j = 2

(2, 4) i = 3 , j = 4 

(2, 4) i = 3 , j = 6



So total number of combinations are 6.
