Question1 :

Given an array A with n elements, find all the pairs in an array 
such that one is square of other number i.e. a[i] = a[j]^2 such 
that i!=j 

For example: 
1 2 4 2 4 7 4

Possible pairs are as follows:

(2, 4) i = 1 , j = 2
(2, 4) i = 1 , j = 4 
(2, 4) i = 1 , j = 6
(2, 4) i = 3 , j = 2
(2, 4) i = 3 , j = 4 
(2, 4) i = 3 , j = 6

So total number of combinations are 6.
